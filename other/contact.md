# Contact

<p class="lead">TAL is developed within the BBC by Future Media in Salford.</p>

There are a number of ways of contacting us. In general github does a great job
of managing developer conversation:

* Raise an issue if you have found a problem with the code or the documentation
* Create a pull request if you want to contribute a patch.

If you want to contact us about anything else please email our
[FMTVP organisation](https://github.com/fmtvp) email address.

Follow us on twitter [@BBCOpenSource](https://twitter.com/BBCOpenSource) for announcements on all of our open source projects, including TAL.

We also occasionally blog on the [BBC Internet Blog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/).
